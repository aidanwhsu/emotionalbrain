# data structure

"X_train", "X_test", consist of 3D fMRI volumes 
"y_train", "y_test" are the labels used for training and testing.

"X_train" contains a total of 740 3D fMRI volumes, from the first 4 runs of all subjects 
"X_test" contains a total of 185 3D fMRI volumes, from the 5th run of all subjects

# downloading dataset into drive
In order to use the dataset [1] in colab, we decided to store the relatively small dataset in google drive.
download dataset from :
https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003548/versions/1.0.0 
upload the dataset into google drive such that the following filepath looks like:
/content/MyDrive/Me/Images/ds003548

## Running Code

The colab is separated into multiple sections. To run the colab, after
downloading the data, simply run sections: \"import\", \"data\", \"train
test split \"and \"Pytorch model\". Do note that the runtime required is
quite long.
